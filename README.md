# PostgreSQL-CRUD
An application in Python that connects to the PostgreSQL database to perform specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Prerequisites
If Python is not installed in your system, then you can install it by running the given command in your terminal:
```pip install python```

Open the command prompt (Windows) or the terminal (MacOS) and run the below command to install psycopg2:
```pip install psycopg2```

Download CRUD-operations.py from my ```source``` folder and setup.sql from my ```scripts``` folder.

### Setting up in PostGreSQL
Login to pgAdmin 4 and create a new database with a name of your choice.
Go to the Query tool and open the setup.sql script to run the example DDL and DLM commands.
These commands create a "students" table and populate the table with initial sample data.
